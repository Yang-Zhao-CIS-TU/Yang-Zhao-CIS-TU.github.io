  bio         : "Welcome! I'm **Yang Zhao**, a Ph.D. student in Computer and Information Science at Temple University, where I specialize in **AI for Science (AI4S)** with a particular focus on:

- **Biomedical data imputation** (image, text, and video)
- **Medical knowledge graph construction and completion**
- **Uncertainty quantification** in deep learning using **topological and diffusion-based methods**

My work bridges deep learning, topology, and medical AI, with applications across image super-resolution, dynamic graph modeling, and explainable diagnosis agents.
