I'm a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer and Information Science](https://www.cis.temple.edu/) at [Temple University](https://www.temple.edu/), advised by [Prof. Mindy Shi](https://www.cis.temple.edu/~mindy/). My research interests lie at the intersection of **topological data analysis**, **score-based diffusion models**, **medical AI**, and **graph-based learning**.

I am currently working on several projects that involve **diffusion modeling for chromatin interaction imputation**, **uncertainty-aware forecasting**, and **dynamic knowledge graphs for healthcare**. I previously worked on deep reinforcement learning and generative models for dynamic spatial-temporal systems.
