Welcome! I'm **Yang Zhao**, a Ph.D. student in Computer and Information Science at Temple University, where I specialize in **AI for Science (AI4S)** with a particular focus on:

- **Biomedical data imputation** (image, text, and video)
- **Medical knowledge graph construction and completion**
- **Uncertainty quantification** in deep learning using **topological and diffusion-based methods**

My work bridges deep learning, topology, and medical AI, with applications across image super-resolution, dynamic graph modeling, and explainable diagnosis agents.

### üî¨ Research Interests
My core research is driven by a desire to make AI more explainable and trustworthy in scientific applications. I explore the use of:
- **Score-based generative models (SGMs)** and **diffusion models**
- **Topological data analysis (TDA)**, including persistent and zigzag homology
- **Graph neural networks (GNNs)** and knowledge graphs for structured reasoning
- **Reinforcement learning** for autonomous systems

### üßæ Recent and Ongoing Projects
- **DREAM-KG (NSF Project)**: Dynamic Knowledge Graphs for explainable AI in homelessness research.
- **ChromDiffusion**: Latent-conditioned diffusion for chromatin interaction data.
- **TOYffusion & TopoSGM**: Topology-aware dynamic diffusion models.
- **DKGM**: Diffusion knowledge graph for medical recommendation (ICHI 2025).
- **Uncertainty Quantification** with conformal and topological techniques in time-series and image forecasting.
